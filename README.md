# Photo-sharing
A functional Photo sharing web app built as requested without liking and commenting of traditional social media.

This was my first React Project. I wanted to build a web app for the people in my family that don't like or use social media. The app itself works fine and my family does use it to share photos but this project's code is quite messy with all the turnary operators and non-DRY layout. I have learned quite a bit since starting this project and now the code here is embarrassing but I am working on refactoring it in my free time.
